Retrospective for project "health survey"

This project had the goal of making a website for a health survey using the "extreme programming" method. Which means 2 coders/developers work on the project at the same time and intensively.

Unfurtunately I had to start my own project with only 48 hours left until delivery time.
I had some communication issues with my parter, who also rather wanted to work alone and solely decide over everything. I felt my co-work was not wanted nor required. I have it two tries, but then had to decide to create own project and try delivering something.

As the song says.... "it takes two to make the thing go right"

I tried making a nice looking website for a health survey, primary layout is mobile-first. But the website is responsive and can be seen in normal browser size. Colors and Logo were chosen after I researched what current websites for health & wellness are using.

I will keep on working on this project to complete it. I need to add the javascript and the php validations. But as for trainer Anita I must deliver the project today.
