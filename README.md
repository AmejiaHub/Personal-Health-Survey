# Personal-Health-Survey
Create a demo online survey that asks questions concerning the personal health of the current visitor.

Performance criteria
Website that functions and looks inviting on mobile and desktop PC
JavaScript form validation (at least one valid input per question page is required)
PHP data collection and feedback generation ($_POST, $_SESSION, string concatenation and templates)

Learning methods
You work as a pair, together with another develper. The site should look good on phones (mobile first) and on a desktop PC. 

Plan, organize and build the website, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, PHP and JavaScript. Then use VS Code, PHP Server, Git/GitHub for developing and source control. Use Figma for the Mockup.
